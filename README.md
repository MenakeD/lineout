# LineOut

This web application is a queue management system which provides a systematic and efficient way to manage queues. It makes use of QR codes to add customers to the queue providing them with a token according to the order of arrival, and notifying them when they are ready to be admitted or served.

The system also provides store or service owners with the ability to manage the queue with ease. It also provides a chat to discuss issues, and concerns and for any other communication within the queue.

The system was designed to provide priority to mobile devices as most users will be using said devices. We also plan to implement mobile-friendly features such as push notifications to provide an enhanced experience by developing the system as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
